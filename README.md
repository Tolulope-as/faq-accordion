## My process
- I had to first go over the design multiple times then when i was understood the design
-Then i proceeded to start writing the HTML code when i was done
- I then started adding styling with css then next was javascript
- I used Javascript to make the buttons hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked.That was all basically.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS position
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned
I learnt more about loops and how to use it too in javascript particularly the for loop

### Continued development
I will love to learn more about while loop and arrays with its different methods.
